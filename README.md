### Support Vector Machine (SVM) Implementation

This repository provides an implementation of the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm for binary classification problems. SVM is a powerful technique for finding a hyperplane that best separates different classes in the feature space. The implementation is based on both the linear and non-linear SVM models.
Overview

Support Vector Machines (SVM) are supervised learning models used for classification tasks. The objective is to find a hyperplane that maximizes the margin between two classes in the feature space. This repository contains code and examples for training and evaluating SVM models, including both linear and kernelized versions.
